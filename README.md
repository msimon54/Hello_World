## About Me

Hello world, my name is Michael Simon. I am a junior at The University of Iowa. I'm studying Finance and Analytics with a minor in communications and earning an entrepreneurial management certificate! I like to play videogames, hangout with friends, and work on old cars. I even learned how to drive a stick shift on a 1931 Ford Model A! I also enjoy sports, more specifically the hawkeye basketball team. Go hawks.
